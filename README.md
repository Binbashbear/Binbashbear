- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Binbashbear
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in electronics (especially arduino/Esp), 
programming, salmon and trout fishing, and electronic music.
- During mating season my interests expand to include sex and technology, particularly teledildonics.
- I have a passing interest in machine learning, both for practical uses such as robotics and biological modelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming, and humility.
- ðŸ“« Reach me in my cave, you can't miss it. I'm active mainly
during spring and summer.
